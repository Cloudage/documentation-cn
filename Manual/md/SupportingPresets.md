# Supporting Presets

In your Editor scripts, use the [ObjectFactory](../ScriptReference/ObjectFactory.html) API to create new GameObjects and components. The ObjectFactory API automatically uses default Presets when creating these items. Your script does not have to search for and apply default Presets; ObjectFactory handles this for you.
